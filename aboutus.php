      <p>
        Our names are Dane Andrews and Jeremy Adams. We're a couple of burgeoning high school students trying to push the limits of DIY nuclear fusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Dane's spare time, he plays the piano and saxophone, codes websites, makes resolutions in Model UN, and tries to get some sleep.

        In Jeremy's spare time, he is a prolific runner, a drummer, and also enjoys getting plenty of sleep.
