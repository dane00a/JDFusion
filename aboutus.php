      <p>
        Our names are Dane Andrews and Jeremy Adams. We're a couple of burgeoning high school students trying to push the limits of DIY nuclear fusion.

        In Dane's spare time, he plays the piano and saxophone, codes websites, and actively participates in Model UN.

        Jeremy is a competitive runner on the cross country and track team and also plays the drums with a couple different bands outside of school.

          We both attend Jones College Prep in downtown Chicago and are currently in our Junior year of high school.
