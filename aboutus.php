      <p>
        Our names are Dane Andrews and Jeremy Adams. We're a couple of curious high school students trying to push the limits of DIY nuclear fusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeremy is a competitive runner on the cross country and track team and also plays the drums with a couple different bands outside of school.

        In Dane's spare time, he plays the piano and saxophone, codes websites, and actively participates in Model UN.

      <p>
          We both attend Jones College Prep in downtown Chicago and are currently in our Junior year of high school.
