          We are two high school students, Jeremy Adams and Dane Andrews, pioneering the development of a novel thermonuclear fusion concept known as the Polywell. We are challenging the limits of DIY science and open sourcing information on our reactor to advance this frontier. This site is made to chronicle our endeavors in the building, research, and experimental trials of our fusion reactor.

                Fusion is being engineered as a clean energy source. Several large-scale projects around the world are making an effort to improve fusion reactor efficiencies. We are building a polywell fusion reactor which uses magnetic fields to trap electrons and fuse deuterium ions. The polywell design has been significantly less explored in fusion sciences. Therefore, we hope to gather valid data from our reactor, helping advance this approach. We are not trying to single-handedly make fusion a compact clean energy source, as large-scale projects with billions of dollars in funding and professional scientists will certainly be more effective in doing so. Mainly, we aspire to push the limits of DIY science as high school students invested in a field few amateur engineers explore.

            <p>
              We started in the spring of our freshman year in high school, exposing ourselves to as much information we could grasp about the workings of nuclear fusion. We took to building a Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor, a relatively simple and common approach to learning the basics of this captivating science. It was a rewarding and occasionally hectic ride, and contributed immensely to the knowledge and experience needed to begin a much more complex reactor that would take several more years of persistence and hard work – the Polywell.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our Demo Model of the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor tested successfully, and created plasma using high voltage to ionize nitrogen with a partial vacuum. Fundamental concepts such as Paschen’s Curve and Inertial Electrostatic Confinement were demonstrated. More on this can be found on the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor Page.
