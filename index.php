            Welcome to the future of Nuclear Fusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're two "Fusioneers", as the term was dubbed; pioneering science students on a mission to create more than a few Facebook posts and earn a few trophies throughout High School. So we pursue Nuclear Fusion, and our demo reactor worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to do a lot more than just that. This site is made to chronicle those endeavours.

              Our Demo Model of the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor tested successfully, and created plasma using Ohm's Law and Inertial Electrostatic Confinement - More on that on the <a href="fusor.php"> Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor Page</a>

              See the media to the right of a test of our Fusor.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some small refinements, we have now preserved this model and moved on to our next project: the Polywell.

          We've begun working on a reactor heavily based off of the Polywell design, a reactor based upon electromagnetism and electron wells. Currently, we're in the final planning stages of the project; building will begin soon on the second amatuer Polywell Nucelar Reactor in existance. <br>

        <p>
          We're very excited for that prospect, however you could also have some involvement as well.
