            Welcome to the future of Nuclear Fusion.
          </p>
          <p>
            We're two "Fusioneers", as the term was dubbed; pioneering science students on a mission to create more than a few Facebook posts and earn a few trophies throughout High School. So we pursue Nuclear Fusion, and our demo reactor worked.
          </p>
          <p>
            We want to do a lot more than just that. This site is made to chronicle those endeavours.

              The Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor was our initial speadhead into nuclear fusion by creating plasma, the step down from creating heavier elements. It was a rewarding if not occasionally hectic ride, and contributed immensely to the knowledge and experience needed to begin the Polywell projet.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our Demo Model of the Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor tested successfully, and created plasma using Ohm's Law and Inertial Electrostatic Confinement - More on that on the <a href="fusor.php"> Farnsworth-Hirsch Fusor Page</a>
            </p>
            <p>
              See the media to the right of a test of our Fusor.
            </p>
            <p>
              After some small refinements, we have now preserved this model and moved on to our next project: the Polywell.

          We've begun working on a reactor heavily based off of the Polywell design, a reactor based upon electromagnetism and electron wells. Currently, we're in the final planning stages of the project; building will soon commence on the second amatuer Polywell Nucelar Reactor in existance. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
          This project is even larger and more complicated of a milestone to conquer, and the clock is ticking. Nuclear fusion is at our fingertips, and we plan to make it a reality before high school ends.
        </p>
        <p>
          We're very excited for that prospect, to say the least. Amazing things lay around the corner for this project.

              That it is. This project is a pioneer in Do-It-Yourself Nuclear Fusion, and is a difficult and ambitious effort.
            </p>
            <p>
              However, no great effort can come into fruition without help. We've conversed with eneryone from graduate students to electricians, contractors to entreprenuers, and other men and women of various occupations.

              But we're not finished. We need you, dear reader. You.
